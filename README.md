This game is about a character running from a policeman dodging
different hurdles by jumping, crouching, and moving left and right. So we
will need to worry about four controls that are normally controlled using a
keyboard. Subway Surfers is a single player mobile gaming app and website
developed by Kiloo. The aim of the game is to outrun a train inspector while
dodging oncoming trains, barriers and other objects. Collecting coins on the
way gives players advantages such as hover boards and high scores

- Up arrow key to make the character jump
- Down arrow key to make the character crouch
- Left arrow key to move the character to left
- Right arrow key to move the character to right

We will implement POSE Detection to play this game
To implement the game control mechanisms, we will need the current pose
info of the person controlling the game, as our intention is to control the
character with the movement of the person in the frame. We want the
gameâ€™s character to move left, right, jump and crouch with the identical
movements of the person.
