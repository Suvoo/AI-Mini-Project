        image:   The input image with a prominent person whose the posture needs to be checked.
        results: The output of the pose landmarks detection on the input image.
        MID_Y:   The intial center y-coordinate of both shoulders landmarks of the person recorded during starting
                 the game. This will give the idea of the person's height when he is standing straight.
        draw:    A boolean value that is if set to true the function writes the posture on the output image. 
        display: A boolean value that is if set to true the function displays the resultant image and returns nothing.

        output_image: The input image with the person's posture written, if it was specified.
